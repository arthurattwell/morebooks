# Textbook policy

The Department of Basic Education has published a draft policy on learner and teacher support materials (LTSM).

We have collected a range of documents and links about the proposed policy, with an emphasis on the issue of one textbook per subject per grade. Please send further information to [support@morebooks.co.za](mailto:support@morebooks.co.za).
