				<h2>A great diversity of books</h2>
                <p>For decades, our government has tried to get textbooks to every South African schoolchild. It has been expensive and complicated, largely because of our long history of unjust education.</p>
				<p>In a bold attempt to solve this problem, the Minister and her team have proposed buying only one textbook (per subject, per grade) for every South African schoolchild.</p>
				<p>This is the wrong approach, and we are asking her to change course. </p>
				<ul>
				<li>Single textbooks narrow the minds of our people: imagine if all our schoolchildren all read only one version of history, life orientation, and literature.</li>
				<li>By picking one textbook, the government would create monopolies for the people that produce them. Monopolies stifle innovation and, without ongoing competition, lead to higher prices over time.</li>
				<li>Our learners are diverse. Different learners need different kinds of textbooks, chosen school by school for their specific needs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We ask the Minister to consider other ways to reduce costs and increase access, and embrace a model that allows a diverse range of textbooks to thrive in our schools. We must all work harder to give our children textbooks, but we should never limit their education by limiting diversity.</p>
