Dear Sir/Madam

I am writing about the DBE's proposed new textbook policies. As my elected representative, I hope that you will take this to heart.

First and foremost, I support the DBE's efforts to get textbooks to every child. Every child should have a minimum schoolbag containing all the books they need.

I strongly disagree with the DBE's proposal to prescribe only one textbook (per subject, per grade) for every child.

*	Single textbooks will narrow our minds, teaching only one version of history, and one view of the world.
*	One textbook will create monopolies that stifle innovation and lead to higher prices.
*	Different learners need different kinds of textbooks, chosen by their teachers to suit their needs.

The DBE is trying to save costs, and the best way to save costs is to help schools re-use their textbooks from year to year.

I also worry that the state will publish our children's textbooks. State publishing is dangerous because the content of our children's books should not be influenced by politics.

Finally, I hope that the state will spend much more on books, so that our schools are filled with a great variety of books. Diversity underpins a great education, and is our nation's greatest strength.

With best wishes

A concerned citizen
