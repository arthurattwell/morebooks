# Have your say

> Need to rant? Whistleblow? Plead for good sense? Anonymously?

We want to hear your arguments against the DBE's [one-textbook proposal](/textbook-policy). If the policy affects you, you probably have strong feelings about it, but don't want to rant publicly. Perhaps your professional position prohibits you from speaking publicly, or you're just uneasy putting your details online.

This form lets you send your **anonymous** comments to us. We will select some and post them to [our Facebook campaign](http://facebook.com/morebks) to be widely shared and discussed. We will *not* use names or any other identifying information when we repost your comments.
