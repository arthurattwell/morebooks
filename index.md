# What is More Books?

More Books is a public campaign to encourage a greater abundance and diversity of books in South African schools. It is driven by private individuals and supporting organisations.

Our original focus was [the Department of Basic Education's proposed 'National Policy for the Provisioning and Management of Learning and Teaching Support Material for Grade Râ€“12'](textbook-policy), which proposed one book per subject per grade.

That campaign raised [significant support](https://www.change.org/p/minister-of-basic-education-angie-motshekga-don-t-prescribe-only-one-textbook-for-every-south-african-child).

Since then, the DBE's policy has evolved. The book-related challenges we are all addressing as South Africans remain large and complex, and we're grateful to everyone who has been a part of this evolution.

While the team behind More Books is currently working on other projects, the conversation continues on [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/morebks/).
